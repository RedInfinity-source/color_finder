# Color Rating Game

This repository contains a simple Python color rating game where you rate randomly generated colors based on their RGB values.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ColorRatingGame.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd ColorRatingGame

Run the game script:
python color_rating_game.py

    In the game, you will be presented with a randomly generated color in RGB format (e.g., R: 255, G: 120, B: 50).

    Rate the color on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you can't see the color and 10 means you like the color.

    Your rating will be recorded, and you can continue rating more colors.

Scoring System

    Rate colors from 0 to 10.
    If you rate a color below 5, you can place a bet (if you have money) to earn more points.
    If you rate a color 8 or higher, you can place a larger bet (if you have money).
    If you can't see the color, rate it as -1.
    The game keeps track of your bets and money.

Customization

Feel free to customize the game and improve it. You can modify the scoring system, change the color generation method, or add more features to make it more engaging.
