# About

The project is a Python-based color guessing game that generates random RGB values for colors and prompts users to rate them on a scale from 0 to 10. If the user cannot see the color, they can input -1. The program adjusts the bet amount and updates the user's money, utilizing concepts like random number generation and list manipulation.

# Features

The Python-based color guessing game features random RGB color generation, a user rating system, and a visibility option for users with color vision deficiencies. Users rate the generated colors on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher ratings indicating more visually appealing colors. The game also includes a betting system, where the bet amount may change based on user actions or color ratings. Additionally, the game allows users to manage their money by updating their funds based on their interactions. The game uses random number generation for RGB values and list manipulation for storing colors and ratings. Overall, this color guessing game combines randomness, user input, and financial management for an engaging experience.

The project showcases basic functionality and randomness, but needs improvement in code structure, user interface, and game mechanics. The code structure should be cleaner and more organized, with clearer variable names and clearer separation of concerns. The user interface should be more engaging and intuitive, and the game mechanics should be refined for a more engaging experience.
